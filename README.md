# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are many ways to ensure that code, program, or software is functional and secure. Some ways include validating input, compiler warnings, default denial, adhering to the principle of least privilege, adopting a secure coding standard, and overall keeping it simple. Developers should automate their processes to make security best practices easier to adopt.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are requirements that add value to a product, service, or environment for a user. To incorporate user needs into a program, we need to engage in a process wherein users understand their problems, processes, goals, and preferences.

# How do I approach designing software?
There are two approaches to designing software. One is the Bottom-up approach, wherein the design starts with the lowest-level components and subsystems. By using these components, the next immediate higher-level components and subsystems are created or composed. This approach can be used to hide the low-level details of implementation and be merged with the top-down technique. Next is, Top-down approach, wherein Each system is divided into several subsystems and components. Each of the subsystems is further divided into a set of subsystems and components. This process of division facilitates in forming of a system hierarchy structure. The main advantage of top-down approach is that its strong focus on requirements helps to make a design responsive according to its requirements.
